# Cleaning the Street Names
Using the provided audit.py several street names were updated from abbreviations to full names.  I added N, S, E, W, Circle, and Highway to the mapping list which updated quite a few more street names.  One could further clean the data by finding addresses that ended with a suite number, county roads and highways that ended with a number, fixing more than the last word, and creating a more extensive list of possible street ending names.
Here are a few updated street names:
6th Ave N => 6th Ave North
Larpenteur Ave W => Larpenteur Ave West
Stinson Blvd => Stinson Boulevard
Here are a few that didn't get updated:
East River Rd/Pkwy => East River Rd/Pkwy
Hopkins Crossroad => Hopkins Crossroad
CR 25 => CR 25

#Query the Database
Using the sample SQL project provided as a starting point I queried the database for counts of nodes, ways, users, ammenities, and other information.
Number of nodes: 1190824
Number of ways: 175548
Number of unique users:  1170
Top contributing users:  [('Mulad', 363169), ('stucki1', 191859), ('Omnific', 110829), ('iandees', 100431), ('woodpeck_fixbot', 55176), ('DavidF', 49305), ('houston_mapper1', 36825), ('rhardy', 35227), ('neuhausr', 34958), ('sota767', 28796)]
Number of users contributing once:  228
Common Ammenities:  ('restaurant', 504)
Biggest religion:  ('christian', 38)
Popular cuisines:  ('pizza', 31)

I was surprised that pizza was the number one cuisine considering the number of steakhouses in Minneapolis and it's proximity and availablity to farms!
